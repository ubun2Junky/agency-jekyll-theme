                <p class="text-muted">With over 30 years of professional experience and early childhood development training, Aracely Possi√© has a passion for working with young children and is an excellent childcare provider. Aracely believes that quality childcare involves not only meeting the basic needs of the child but also creating a safe, clean and happy environment where children can thrive socially, emotionally and academically. As a mother of 6 children (and grandmother to 16), Aracely founded her own childcare center to meet the needs of families who share these same values.</p>
